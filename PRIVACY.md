# Privacy Policy for The Costumemaster: Reloaded

The Costumemaster aims to be a simple game that uses as little data as possible. Below is the privacy policy that outlines what is collected, how it’s used, and how it can be deleted/reset at the user’s request. This policy has been written at the request of the App Store Review team so that users can view this information from the App Store.

## What is collected?

The app does **not** collect any data from the user. However, any feedback given back to me is collected anonymously and put into YouTrack so that the issue can be tracked accordingly. For more information on feedback collection policies, please visit https://itch.io/t/1492114/a-note-about-bug-reports-and-feedback.

## Why this data is collected?

I have found that it is unnecessary for this app to collect data on its players, so no data is collected.
