The following subdirectory is used to build a click package for Ubuntu Touch.

Thanks to @abmyii for making this possible!

> :warning: This is still highly experimental. Visual glitches may ensue.

## Build instructions

1. Export the project for Linux or HTML.
2. Copy the pck file to the root of this directory and rename it to `costumemaster.pck`.
3. Run `clickable`.
