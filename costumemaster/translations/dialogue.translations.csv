INTRO_01,"Ah, crap, I overslept again."
INTRO_02,"That party was something..."
INTRO_03,"And with this thing on? Jeez, I must be asking for trouble."
INTRO_04,"I should probably get this costume off."
INTRO_05,"Crap. The zipper's coming undone."
INTRO_06,"I'm gonna have to grab my seam ripper from the office to fix it."
INTRO_07,"Let's hope this is a quick fix."
T02_01,"Uh... what?"
T02_02,"I thought I had gotten out of here..."
T02_03,"Maybe I'm just imagining things. Let's try this again."
T02_04,"I... don't remember this being here..."
T02_05,"Looks like the lever over there is connected to the door, too."
T02_06,"Huh. Really weird."
TIMER_INTRO_01,"What. The. Hell?"
TIMER_INTRO_02,"I swear I was on my way to my home office!"
TIMER_INTRO_03,"Is this gonna keep repeating like a dream?"
TIMER_INTRO_04,"Oh, well. Better try to get through that door. It looks like it's connected to the alarm clock."
BLOCKED_BIRD_01,"Crap! How am I supposed to get through here?"
BLOCKED_BIRD_02,"This armoire is too heavy to move."
BLOCKED_BIRD_03,"Maybe I can get through that gap if I had a different costume on?"
CARPET_INTRO_01,"What kind of contraption is this?"
CARPET_INTRO_02,"I swear, I never had this pressure-looking button in my room, let alone the rest of the house."
CARPET_INTRO_03,"Looks like I got to find something to 'weigh' it down, I suppose."
CARPET_INTRO_04,"Maybe I can try moving the dresser?"
ESCAPE_01,"Ugh... why does this costume feel so much more hot and stuffy...?"
ESCAPE_02,"Wh-what?! No, there's no way..."
ESCAPE_03,"There's no way I'm wearing all three at once!"
ESCAPE_04,"I have to get these costumes off of me, fast!"
ESCAPE_05,"Please tell me I'm not gonna keep looping with this on..."
ESCAPE_06,"Oh, thank goodness. Finally!"
ESCAPE_07,"The seam ripper is over there in the vanity in the corner."
ESCAPE_08,"The sooner I can get there, the sooner I can take this off..."
CUTSCN_END,"Time to finally take this off..."
